# Query Performance Optimization Report

## Initial Query Analysis
- **Initial Complexity:** 4 table joins
- **Performance Bottlenecks:**
  - No filtering before joins
  - Full table scans
  - Lack of targeted indexing

## Optimization Strategies Applied
1. **Filtering with Common Table Expression (CTE)**
   - Reduced data volume early in query execution
   - Prefiltered `confirmed` bookings
   - Minimized unnecessary join processing

2. **Indexing Recommendations**
   - `idx_booking_status_date`: Optimizes status and date filtering
   - `idx_booking_user_property`: Accelerates user and property joins

3. **Query Refinement**
   - Removed redundant columns
   - Added LIMIT to control result set
   - Maintained join relationship integrity

## Expected Performance Improvements
- **Estimated Query Time Reduction:** 40-60%
- **Resource Utilization:** Significantly decreased
- **Scalability:** Improved with targeted indexing

## Recommended Next Steps
- Conduct performance testing
- Monitor query execution plans
- Fine-tune indexes based on actual usage patterns
